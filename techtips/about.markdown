Welcome! This is Catherine's blog for sharing tech tips for devices in the Apple and Amazon Alexa ecosystems.

It can be overwhelming learning a lot of technical information at once! When I am learning new ways to use tech, I generally don't learn it all at one time. Instead, I pick up little tips and tricks one at a time, play with them, and integrate them into my general knowledge of how to make my devices work as well as possible for myself. 

The hope and the idea of this blog is to give the reader the same experience I have when learning tech - not a giant infodump, but little bite-sized ideas to play with to make your life with technology easier and maybe even more fun.

This blog is created with the static site generator [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and is hosted by GitHub Pages. Building this blog is also a good technical exercise for me in learning to use static site generation and versioning in GitHub repositories!

I hope you enjoy! Please e-mail me with any questions, corrections, or ideas for topics for future posts - I would love to hear them.
